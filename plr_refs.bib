The  modelshows an inhomogeneous quasistationary pattern with many different clusters of particles arranged periodicallyin space. We derive the equation for the macroscopic density of particles, perform a linear stability analysis onit, and show that there is a finite-wavelength instability leading to pattern formation. This is responsible for theapproximate periodicity with which the clusters of particles arrange in the microscopic model. In addition, weconsider the population when immersed in a fluid medium and analyze the influence of advection on globalproperties of the model, such as the average number of individuals},

@article{sasaki1997clumped,
  abstract = {The paper studies the spatial distribution of individuals competing for a continuously distributed
resource in one-dimensional space. An individual diffuses randomly, and is assumed to suffer a cost
of mortality from neighbors. The population dynamics are then described by an extended version of
the Lotkaâ€“Volterra competition equation with terms of growth and diffusion, and the term of
neighborhood competition/interference through an integral kernel. By allowing neighboring individuals
to compete with each other, the pattern of spatial distribution changes drastically from that of the
classical models without any neighborhood competition: in the classical models, any spatial variation
in resource availability is smoothed out in the stationary distribution of species utilizing it. However,
in the present model, even negligibly small spatial variation in resource availability could trigger a
strongly clumped distribution of the species with a characteristic wavelength. Significant amplification
of intermediate spatial frequencies occurs if the width of detrimental influence exceeds the mean distance
an individual diffuses before it reproduces. In the extreme of no diffusion, the stationary distribution
(the ideal free distribution) is strictly discrete (the support of distribution given by a set of points).
The model also reveals the condition for a periodic/quasi-periodic traveling wave when the species
is expanding in space, and demonstrates complex spatial distributions in two dimension.},

@article{ghosh2022emergent,
  abstract = {The genetic composition of the gut microbiota is constantly reshaped by ecological and evolutionary forces. These strain-level dynamics can be challenging to understand because they emerge from complex spatial growth processes that take place within a host. Here we introduce a general population genetic framework to predict how stochastic evolutionary forces emerge from simple models of microbial growth in spatially extended environments like the intestinal lumen. Our framework shows how fluid flow and longitudinal variation in growth rate combine to shape the frequencies of genetic variants in sequenced fecal samples, yielding analytical expressions for the effective generation times, selection coefficients, and rates of genetic drift. We find that the emergent evolutionary dynamics can often be captured by well-mixed models that lack explicit spatial structure, even when there is substantial spatial variation in species-level composition. By applying these results to the human colon, we find that continuous fluid flow and simple forms of wall growth are unlikely to create sufficient bottlenecks to allow large fluctuations in mutant frequencies within a host. We also find that the effective gener-ation times may be significantly shorter than expected from traditional average growth rate estimates. Our results provide a starting point for qua ntifying genetic turnover in spatially extended settings like the gut microbiota, and may be relevant for other microbial ecosystems where unidirectional fluid flow plays an important role.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
