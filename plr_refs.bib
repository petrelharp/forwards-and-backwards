@article{sasaki1997clumped,
  abstract = {The paper studies the spatial distribution of individuals competing for a continuously distributed
resource in one-dimensional space. An individual diffuses randomly, and is assumed to suffer a cost
of mortality from neighbors. The population dynamics are then described by an extended version of
the Lotka–Volterra competition equation with terms of growth and diffusion, and the term of
neighborhood competition/interference through an integral kernel. By allowing neighboring individuals
to compete with each other, the pattern of spatial distribution changes drastically from that of the
classical models without any neighborhood competition: in the classical models, any spatial variation
in resource availability is smoothed out in the stationary distribution of species utilizing it. However,
in the present model, even negligibly small spatial variation in resource availability could trigger a
strongly clumped distribution of the species with a characteristic wavelength. Significant amplification
of intermediate spatial frequencies occurs if the width of detrimental influence exceeds the mean distance
an individual diffuses before it reproduces. In the extreme of no diffusion, the stationary distribution
(the ideal free distribution) is strictly discrete (the support of distribution given by a set of points).
The model also reveals the condition for a periodic/quasi-periodic traveling wave when the species
is expanding in space, and demonstrates complex spatial distributions in two dimension.},

@article{ghosh2022emergent,
  abstract = {The genetic composition of the gut microbiota is constantly reshaped by ecological and evolutionary forces. These strain-level dynamics can be challenging to understand because they emerge from complex spatial growth processes that take place within a host. Here we introduce a general population genetic framework to predict how stochastic evolutionary forces emerge from simple models of microbial growth in spatially extended environments like the intestinal lumen. Our framework shows how fluid flow and longitudinal variation in growth rate combine to shape the frequencies of genetic variants in sequenced fecal samples, yielding analytical expressions for the effective generation times, selection coefficients, and rates of genetic drift. We find that the emergent evolutionary dynamics can often be captured by well-mixed models that lack explicit spatial structure, even when there is substantial spatial variation in species-level composition. By applying these results to the human colon, we find that continuous fluid flow and simple forms of wall growth are unlikely to create sufficient bottlenecks to allow large fluctuations in mutant frequencies within a host. We also find that the effective gener-ation times may be significantly shorter than expected from traditional average growth rate estimates. Our results provide a starting point for qua ntifying genetic turnover in spatially extended settings like the gut microbiota, and may be relevant for other microbial ecosystems where unidirectional fluid flow plays an important role.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here we predict conditions that lead to nonequilibrium geographic distributions of mtDNA lineages, test the robustness of these predictions and examine mtDNA data sets for consistency with our model. Under a simple isolation by distance model, the variance of an mtDNA lineage's geographic distribution is expected be proportional to its age. Simulation results indicated that this relationship is fairly robust. Analysis of mtDNA data from natural populations revealed three qualitative distributional patterns: (1) significant departure of lineage structure from equilibrium geographic distributions, a pattern exhibited in three rodent species with limited dispersal; (2) nonsignificant departure from equilibrium expectations, exhibited by two avian and two marine fish species with potentials for relatively long-distance dispersal; and (3) a progression from nonequilibrium distributions for younger lineages to equilibrium distributions for older lineages, a condition displayed by one surveyed avian species. These results demonstrate the advantages of considering mutation and genealogy in the interpretation of mtDNA geographic variation.},

However, current methods are limited, and the most accurate techniques are able to process no more than a hundred samples. As datasets that consist of millions of genomes are now being collected, there is a need for scalable and efficient inference methods to fully utilize these resources. Here we introduce an algorithm that is able to not only infer whole-genome histories with comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art but also process four orders of magnitude more sequences. The approach also provides an ‘evolutionary encoding’ of the data, enabling efficient calculation of relevant statistics. We apply the method to human data from the 1000 Genomes Project, Simons Genome Diversity Project and UK Biobank, showing that the inferred genealogies are rich in biological signal and efficient to process.},

The {SLiM} forward genetic simulation framework is one of the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However, its foundation in the Wright-Fisher model has been found to pose an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult to adapt the Wright-Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space, overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction, density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in dispersal or migration, local extinction and recolonization, mating between subpopulations, age structure, fitness-based survival and hard selection, emergent sex ratios, and so forth. In response to this need, we here introduce {SLiM} 3, which contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these limitations. First, the new non-Wright-Fisher or "{nonWF}" model type provides a much more flexible foundation that allows the easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more. Second, {SLiM} 3 adds support for continuous space, including spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables. We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and present several example models to illustrate their use.},

Environmental variability can also cause clustering: for example, marine turbulence transports plankton2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and produces chlorophyll concentration patterns in the upper ocean9,10,11. Even in a homogeneous environment, nonlinear interactions between species12,13,14 can result in spontaneous pattern formation. Here we show that a population of independent, random-walking organisms (‘brownian bugs’), reproducing by binary division and dying at constant rates, spontaneously aggregates. Using an individual-based model, we show that clusters form out of spatially homogeneous initial conditions without environmental variability, predator–prey interactions, kinesis or taxis. The clustering mechanism is reproductively driven—birth must always be adjacent to a living organism. This clustering can overwhelm diffusion and create non-poissonian correlations between pairs (parent and offspring) or organisms, leading to the emergence of patterns.},
