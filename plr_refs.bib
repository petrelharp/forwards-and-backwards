  abstract = {We introduce a simple model of population dynamics which considers reproducing individuals or particleswith  birth  and  death  rates  depending  on  the  number  of  other  individuals  in  their  neighborhood. The  modelshows an inhomogeneous quasistationary pattern with many different clusters of particles arranged periodicallyin space. We derive the equation for the macroscopic density of particles, perform a linear stability analysis onit, and show that there is a finite-wavelength instability leading to pattern formation. This is responsible for theapproximate periodicity with which the clusters of particles arrange in the microscopic model. In addition, weconsider the population when immersed in a fluid medium and analyze the influence of advection on globalproperties of the model, such as the average number of individuals},

@article{sasaki1997clumped,
  abstract = {The paper studies the spatial distribution of individuals competing for a continuously distributed
resource in one-dimensional space. An individual diffuses randomly, and is assumed to suffer a cost
of mortality from neighbors. The population dynamics are then described by an extended version of
the Lotkaâ€“Volterra competition equation with terms of growth and diffusion, and the term of
neighborhood competition/interference through an integral kernel. By allowing neighboring individuals
to compete with each other, the pattern of spatial distribution changes drastically from that of the
classical models without any neighborhood competition: in the classical models, any spatial variation
in resource availability is smoothed out in the stationary distribution of species utilizing it. However,
in the present model, even negligibly small spatial variation in resource availability could trigger a
strongly clumped distribution of the species with a characteristic wavelength. Significant amplification
of intermediate spatial frequencies occurs if the width of detrimental influence exceeds the mean distance
an individual diffuses before it reproduces. In the extreme of no diffusion, the stationary distribution
(the ideal free distribution) is strictly discrete (the support of distribution given by a set of points).
The model also reveals the condition for a periodic/quasi-periodic traveling wave when the species
is expanding in space, and demonstrates complex spatial distributions in two dimension.},
